A simple shopping app for android its built in android studio.

Its simple to use just input item name to text box and press add to insert an item to the list, tapping an item crosses it out and the delete button deletes the item.

To install use android studio to build on an emulator or a connected device via adb.

Any issues or questions let me know.
